# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide a comparitive analysis of schools within a school district to be provided to the school board for budget allocation.

## Overview of Project
In this project we were told that Thomas High School had provided us with altered data for their ninth grade students. We were therefore asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact and update the school district analysis with the new data.

## Analysis
Here is a list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data:
1. Total School Budget: Remained unchanged at $1,043,130
2. Budget per Student: Remained unchanged at $638 spent per year per student
3. Average Math Score:Remained unchanged at 83.35
4. Average Reading Score: Moved lower slightly to 83.72 from 83.89
5. % Passing Math: This metric jumped dramatically from 66.9% to 93%
6. % Passing Reading: This metric went up as well from 69.7% to 97%
7. % Overall Passing: This metric also went up from 65% to 90.6%

## Summary
Overall Thomas High School has moved from the bottom ten schools to the top five schools in the district.

This is significant because it is a charter school type and the entire top five schools is comprised of charter schools.
